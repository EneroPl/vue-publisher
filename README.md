# vue-publisher

This boilerplate provides a pure Vue template with minimal configuration settings for developing components and more with the idea that you will publish your masterpiece on npm, yarn or other platforms.

Of course, you can use `@vue-cli`, but it seemed to me that for publishing a small component, there are a lot of packages that are pulled up by this template.

## Install & Usage

```sh
// Just clone this repo and have fun
git clone https://github.com/EneroPl/vue-publisher.git
```
